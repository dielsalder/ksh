Overall goal:    make better helix parameter method


  Aim 1.    Develop a method to measure global DNA bending


  First, establish minimum number of base pairs needed to obtain an accurate helical axis. Is 5 bp the minimum number of bp needed to accurately define a helical axis of duplex DNA? Is 4 bp? 3 bp? What are the residuals? Most importantly, do the orientations of helical axes obtained from fitting < 5 bp the same as that obtained from >= 5 bp?

  Second, tabulate the range of residuals that you get from a good fit. That is, what is a good fit? What is a bad fit? Establish this range of acceptable residuals by calculating residuals for ideal B-DNA molecules using > 5 bps.

  Third, test methods to optimize the position of distinct and well-defined helical axis from independent segments of a larger DNA molecule suspected of being bent. How many bps to include in each? How do allow segments to grow; how do we set the size of these segments? Do we need to think about ways to keep the segments from overlapping? All these questions should be at least guessed at by above First and Second sections.




  Aim 2. Develop a method to calculate local helicoidal parameters
