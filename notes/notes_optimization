optimization is broken.
res_phi_ls takes phi, returns residual of start rotated to phi
res_the_ls takes the, returns residual of start rotated to the
phimin is the minimum of res_phi_ls, which is to say the phi that produces the least residual
ditto for themin
[x] check whether either phimin or themin are correct
    - phi = 0.0 in both, the is different
    - residual is different
        - it should be about 13 but in kSH.eio.py it's around 3000
    - radius is not a number

[x] check residual function. which one was used in kSH.py? make sure
    - commented out res_x (kevin's residual algorithm)
    - what do you know, it's that one
