Notes on kSH.py:
    - pep8 it.
    - make input angles into command line callable arguments
    - write some rudimentary kind of interface
    - what arguments should the helical parameter functions take?
    - recursive class functions?
    - add phi and res min to class
    - phi and theta angles in crdset class
    - function for printing things
    - inheritance - rotated crds object inherits from crdset object
    will there be too many classes
    - implement minitr-ing
    - clean up printer for no rotations
