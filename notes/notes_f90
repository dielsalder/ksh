- implement l-bfgs.
	- make SVA into a function
	[ ] what is input for SVA?
	[ ] figure out information flow (a and b mats?)
	[ ] align variables correctly
	- how to make bfgs step?
	- lines 36-37 in sr.residual
	- read:
		- stopping/termination tests
		- machine precision
		- how functions work in fortran
		- do loop syntax
		- arithmetic, scientific notation 
		- stepwise?
        - call bfgs using res function
                * must output the same variables
                - residual array (RESMAT) no longer needed
